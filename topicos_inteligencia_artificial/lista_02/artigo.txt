Convolutional networks (ConvNets) have recently enjoyed a great success in large-scale image and video recognition (Krizhevsky, 2012) which has become possible due to the large public image repositories, such as ImageNet (Deng, 2009), and high-performance computing systems, such as GPUs or large-scale distributed clusters (Dean, 2012). In particular, an important role in the advance of deep visual recognition architectures has been played by the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) (Russakovsky, 2014), which has served as a testbed for a few generations of large-scale image classification systems, from high-dimensional shallow feature encodings (Perronnin, 2010) (the winner of ILSVRC-2011) to deep ConvNets (Krizhevsky, 2014) (the winner of ILSVRC-2012).
